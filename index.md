# NFC Ring Lockbox

My project is essentially a box that is locked from the inside, and there is a sensor on the inside lid that can detect an NFC tag to open the box. The lock mechanism consists of a servo and an inside lock system.

# Second Milestone


My second milestone was getting the components to function with the bigger box. Everything was temporarily taped to the inside lid of the box, but it was secure enough for the lock to work and keep the box closed. I also 3d printed a new lock mechanism that was more sturdy than the makeshift one I had for the smaller box. The power bank was contained inside as well, so my next goal is to drill a hole for the power bank to be able to be charged while staying inside the box


# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was getting the small box to fully function with the lock component. I started off by wiring everything into the arduino and the nfc sensor, which went smoothly. Then, I attempted to upload the premade code onto my arduino, which I had a lot of trouble with. Once I got the software to detect my arduino, I changed the code to detect the card and the blue tag, which made the servo turn, unlatching from its locked position. I taped everything in temporary positions inside the lid of the box to make sure it could open and close. My plan now is to transfer everything into the bigger box, and find a way to keep the power bank inside the box, having it deliver power to the arduino and be charged at the same time.

# Starter Project

My starter project was the TV-B-Gone. I enjoyed this starter project and I liked learning how to solder
