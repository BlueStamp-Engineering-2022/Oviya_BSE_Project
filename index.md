# NFC Ring Lockbox
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone


My second milestone was getting the components to function with the bigger box. Everything was temporarily taped to the inside lid of the box, but it was secure enough for the lock to work and keep the box closed. I also 3d printed a new lock mechanism that was more sturdy than the makeshift one I had for the smaller box. The power bank was contained inside as well, so my next goal is to drill a hole for the power bank to be able to be charged while staying inside the box


# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was getting the small box to fully function with the lock component. I started off by wiring everything into the arduino and the nfc sensor, which went smoothly. Then, I attempted to upload the premade code onto my arduino, which I had a lot of trouble with. Once I got the software to detect my arduino, I changed the code to detect the card and the blue tag, which made the servo turn, unlatching from its locked position. I taped everything in temporary positions inside the lid of the box to make sure it could open and close. My plan now is to transfer everything into the bigger box, and find a way to keep the power bank inside the box, having it deliver power to the arduino and be charged at the same time.

# Starter Project

My starter project was the TV-B-Gone. I enjoyed this starter project and I liked learning how to solder
