# NFC Ring Lockbox
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was getting the small box to fully function with the lock component. I started off by wiring everything into the arduino and the nfc sensor, which went smoothly. Then, I attempted to upload the premade code onto my arduino, which I had a lot of trouble with. Once I got the IDE to detect my arduino, I changed the code to detect the card and the blue tag, which made the servo turn, unlatching from its locked position
